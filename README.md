A Foodies website where you can review restaurants and view what other people post. Here is a redesign of this in Figma: https://www.figma.com/proto/Iwgg1xLfevpn1hVsoatnC1/Arianny-UX-Class-Figma-exercise-SS24?node-id=4367-13&t=4vj7LW8fkfA04r3V-1 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
